### Hello, I'm ZoÃ©! ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from INSA Rouen Normandie in 2018 with a specialization in applied Mathematics. Following that, I pursued a year as a Research Engineer at INSA Rouen Normandie, collaborating with the H. Becquerel Center in Rouen on medical image segmentation. Subsequently, I embarked on a doctoral thesis at INSA Rouen Normandie focusing on medical image segmentation using hybrid variational approaches and deep learning techniques, under the supervision of Carole Le Guyader from LMI and Caroline Petitjean from LITIS. I successfully defended my Ph.D on December 9, 2022. Since January 2, 2023, I have been working as a postdoctoral researcher at CEREMA on the DEPHY3GEO project, focusing on cliff image segmentation from drone imagery. Alongside my postdoc, I am also involved in teaching activities at INSA, serving as a full professor in the Mathematics department and as a teaching assistant in the STPI department.
